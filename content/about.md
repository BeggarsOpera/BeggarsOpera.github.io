This site will integrate the authoritative edition of the text (the first) and the authoritative edition of the music (the third). Since The Beggar’s Opera was first staged in 1728, it has been, along with Gulliver’s Travels and Robinson Crusoe, among the most influential and enduring of eighteenth-century English texts. It has been performed countless times; it has been printed and reprinted in innumerable editions, and it has inspired adaptations from a remarkable range of artists, among them Bertolt Brecht, Elizabeth Hauptmann, and Kurt Weill’s Threepenny Opera (1928), Duke Ellington and John La Touche’s Beggar’s Holiday (1946), Vaclav Havel’s Žebrácká Opera (1975), Wole Soyinka’s Opera Wonyosi (1977), and Stephen Jeffreys’ The Convict’s Opera (2008). The Beggar’s Opera was performed at the Edinburgh Festival in 2018 and at Versailles in 2019. Yet despite its ubiquity, importance, and congeniality to a digital environment where its blend of text, music, and image might properly be brought to life, no site realizes the play’s potential to inform and stimulate students and scholars.

Our site project aims to produce a readable scholarly edition that will provide simultaneous access to the authoritative textual and musical editions for the first time, allowing readers to see changes among the various iterations. This will not only be useful for scholarly study of the play, but will also further discussions about what a digital edition can do better than print editions, as well as what print editions cannot do at all.

The edition will integrate clips of music and dramatic performance, essays that illuminate the social and historical contexts of the play, and a range of materials that track its remarkable influence. Beyond this, we aim to provide a proof-of-concept for representing musical theater digitally, as well as documentation of the project’s evolution—the challenges we faced and how we met them.

By addressing the challenges involved in presenting music, text, and image in a digital medium, we aim to stimulate others to construct DH sites on musical theater, be it Handel’s Acis and Galatea (for which Gay furnished the libretto), Guys and Dolls, or Hedwig and The Angry Inch. While there have been many attempts to address the challenges and opportunities of representing and teaching theater in a digital environment, the field is still emerging; and musical theater is barely represented.

We have drafted a CETEIcean markup version and a TEI-XML markup of the first edition of text and the MEI markup for the scored music for the third; we have historical images, data on performances, and a video of a performance we staged in Williamsburg; we have server space and a URL; we have conducted interviews about what students and instructors want from such a site.
