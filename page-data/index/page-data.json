Recent editions by Lewis (1973), Fuller (1983), and Gladfelder (2013), do not include the music, reasoning that it can be found elsewhere, as in Barlow's standard edition of the music only (1990). But this splits apart the essential twinning of text and music, word and song at the heart of the play. This edition also seeks to acknowledge recent challenges to authorial intent as the determining criterion by retaining inconsistencies in printing where there is no good reason to assume authorial intent, thereby acknowledging the contingencies of the publication process. More on the editorial principles behind this edition can be found here.</p>\n<h2>Editorial Approach</h2>\n<p>The only recent editions to include the music are faulty in other ways. Lindley and Jones (2010) do not include the overture, despite using the third edition as the music copy-text, and they follow the second edition's integration of the music into the body of the text, even though there is good reason to believe that the third edition, which reverts to the first's practice of putting the scored music at the end, had authorial sanction. The other version from the past to print music and text, from Project Gutenberg (2008)—which is also the only other online version—reprints Lovat Fraser's 1921 edition, which, though historically significant, is itself based on the non-standard 1765 edition. Other editions that combine text and music are either long out of print (Roberts and Smith, 1969) and/or are problematic in other ways.</p>\n<h2>Technical Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>This digital edition was built using open-source tools for TEI presentation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean\">CETEIcean</a></strong> - A JavaScript library for displaying TEI XML in the browser, developed by the TEI Consortium</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/cu-mkp/gatsby-theme-ceteicean\">gatsby-theme-ceteicean</a></strong> - A Gatsby starter theme for creating CETEIcean-based digital editions, developed by the Making and Knowing Project at Columbia University</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/GrantLS/TEI-Boilerplate\">TEI Boilerplate</a></strong> - An XSLT-based framework for publishing TEI documents directly in web browsers, created by Grant Leyton Simpson</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are grateful to the creators and maintainers of these projects for making scholarly digital editions more accessible.</p>","title":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["1271339121","2524171988","2787930769"]}
